### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am new to tech and coding.

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Software Development with the Tech Academy. I love it so far.
 
 ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
 
âš¡ Fun facts: 1)I enjoy handwriting analysis as a hobby. 
2) I like to play a game with my Alexa timer when cooking; I like to ask how much time is remaining on the timer and get as close to zero as possible. It's oddly gratifying when it's either "less than 10 seconds" or when Alexa says "your timer is going off now." Haha.
